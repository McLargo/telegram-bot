# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for considering contributing to this project. It is a personal project
with no clear scope, where I will contribute as much as I can.

As today, no hard rules to contribute. Just follow the following guidelines:

- Install pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency. You can do
  this by running the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

- Follow the existing code style and conventions. The project uses
  [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).

- Create a new branch, work on your changes and push to the repository. Create a
  pull request when you are ready to merge your changes, and I will review it as
  soon as possible.
